DHA is known to support cognitive function and visual development, which are crucial during the first few years of life. As a result, infant formula brands have started incorporating marine plant-derived DHA to meet consumer demand for natural, plant-based, and sustainably sourced ingredients. Furthermore, with the growing preference for plant-based diets and the increasing incidence of lactose intolerance, many parents are opting for non-dairy formula options enriched with marine plant-derived DHA. This trend has led to substantial investments in R&D by manufacturers to improve the efficiency of DHA extraction from marine plants and to enhance the sensory properties of infant formula products. Moreover, the regulatory environment surrounding infant formula in the United States ensures that products containing DHA are subject to rigorous testing for safety and efficacy. The FDA has laid down guidelines on the inclusion of DHA in infant formula, which has instilled confidence among consumers. Given the growing number of working parents and the increasing rate of formula feeding, this segment is projected to witness steady growth in the coming years.
